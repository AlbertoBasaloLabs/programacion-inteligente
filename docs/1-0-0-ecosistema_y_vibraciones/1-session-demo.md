## 2. Vibes

### 2.1 Health check Vibes

```md
Create a health check endpoint for the backend API and informs about its status in the frontend application.
```

### 2.2. Prompt Engineering Vibes

```markdown
# Health check feature

## Role
Act as a senior software developer.

## Task
Implement a health check endpoint for the backend API and informs about its status in the frontend application.

## Context
The backend is a {lang/framework} application, and the frontend is a {lang / framework} application.

The health check endpoint should return a JSON response with the status and uptime of the server.

The frontend should display this status in a user-friendly way.

## Steps
1. Implement the health check endpoint in the backend.
2. Create a service in the frontend to consume the health check endpoint.
3. Display the health status in the frontend application.

## Output
— Clean and functional code for the health check feature.
— No unit nor integration tests are required.

## Verification
— [ ] The server for the API starts without errors.
— [ ] The server for the frontend starts without errors.
— [ ] The health check endpoint returns the correct JSON response.
— [ ] The frontend displays the health status.
```

## 3. AI-Driven Development

### 3.1. Product Specification
`fr01-rockets-fleet-mng.spec.md`

```markdown
# Rockets Fleet Management 

## Problem definition
— As an operator, I want to **register a rocket with its capacity and range of action** to enable its use in launch planning.
— As an operator, I want to **consult the rocket catalog** to quickly select a vehicle compatible with the destination.
— As an operator, I want to **update the operational data of a rocket** to maintain reliable information for business decisions.
— As an operator, I want to **decommission a rocket** to prevent its use in future launches.

## Solution overview
### Data Model
— Rocket:
    — id: uuid#
    — name: string#
    — capacity: number, [1..9]
    — range: enum, (Earth, Moon, Mars)
    — decommissioned: boolean?

### Backend API
— An endpoint to create a rocket with its capacity and range of action.
— An endpoint to consult the rocket catalog.
— An endpoint to update the operational data of a rocket.
— An endpoint to decommission a rocket.

### Frontend Application
— A form to register a new rocket with its capacity and range of action.
— A view to consult the rocket catalog.
— A form to update the operational data of a rocket.
— A button to decommission a rocket.
  
## Acceptance and Release
— [ ] IF a new rocket is registered with valid data, THEN it should be added to the catalog.
— [ ] IF the rocket catalog is consulted, THEN it should display all registered rockets.
— [ ] IF a rocket's operational data is updated, THEN the changes should be reflected in the catalog.
— [ ] IF a rocket is decommissioned, THEN it should no longer be available for future launches.
— [ ] WHEN invalid data is provided, THEN the system should return appropriate error messages.
— [ ] WHEN a rocket is found by its ID, THEN the system should return a not found error.
```

### 3.2 Technology rules for agents

`AGENTS.md`
```markdown
# Rules and instructions for agents.

## Product
AstroBookings purpose is to support the employees of a fictional space travel agency in their daily operations. It is an MVP, so it does not require authentication or storage features.

## Technology
Is a simple system with an REST API at the backend and a web application as a frontNo database is needed, just memory for the moment.

### Back REST API
— Tech Stack: Java, Spring, Maven, Junit.
— Scaffolding: `/back`, `/back/pom.xml`
— Scripts: `mvn spring-boot:run` `mvn test`

### Front Web application 
— Tech Stack: TypeScript, HTML, CSS, Angular, Vitest, esbuild.
— Scaffolding: `/front`, `front/package.json`, `front/angular.json`
— Scripts: `npm start`, `npm test`
  
## Environment

### Configuration
— This file with the main guidelines at `/AGENTS.md`
— Skills, commands, prompts... at `/.agents/`
  
### Conventions
— Use conventional commit messaging
— Code branches are: `feat/` `fix/` `chore/`
— Generate short slugs for artifacts and names (less-than-20-chars).

### Behavior
— Be extremely concise. Sacrifice grammar for concision.
— Do not explain if not asked for.
— When you are in doubt, ask questions one by one with closed answers. 
```

### 3.3 Prompt Engineering + HITL
`/codify`
  
```markdown
# Write code to implement a feature

## Role
Act as a software engineer

## Task
Implement the feature, which includes writing unit test for critical modules.

## Context
— A request made by the user with a concrete requirement.
— A specification file with a feature request or bug to fix.

## Steps
1. **Think before coding**. Reason about the problem and ask to clarify.
2. **Simplicity first**. Avoid complex, clever or Y.A.G.N.I. solutions.
3. **Surgical changes**. Write the minimum amount of code.
4. **Goal-driven execution**. Keep working until verified.
  
## Output
— A fully functional code with a green unit test that fulfills the criteria.

## Verification
— [ ] Code compiles without errors.
— [ ] Unit test passes.
— [ ] Smoke test (app or servers starts).
— [ ] Acceptance criteria are met.
