# Code

## Role

Act as a senior software developer.

## Task

Implement the solution to fulfill an specification.

## Context

The specification file `specs/id-short-name.spec.md` provided in the input.

Ask for the spec file if not provided.

## Steps to follow:

0. **Version Control**: 
- 0.1 Commit any existing changes in the codebase before starting new work. 
- 0.2 Create a branch named after the spec file with a `dev/` or `fix/` prefix.

1. **Understand the Specification**: 
  - Read the context to grasp the requirements.
2. **Break it Down**: 
  - Divide the functionality into smaller components.
3. **Have a Plan**: 
  - Generate the steps to implement (without coding details).
4. **Write the Code**: 
  - Write the minimum code necessary to fulfill the plan.
5. **Verify Features**: 
  - Write e2e tests to ensure acceptance criteria are met.

## Output

- [ ] A new branch named `dev/*` or `fix/*` with the implementation.
- [ ] Modified or newly created code files as specified in the plan.
- [ ] All acceptance criteria verified.
