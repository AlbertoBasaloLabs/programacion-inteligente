Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous. Focus on:

- Problem/Goal: What problem does this solve?
- Target Users: Who will use this product?
- Core Functionality: What are the key actions?
- Scope/Boundaries: What should it NOT do?

### Step 2: Drafting the PRD

Draft the PRD following the [PRD template](PRD.md)
Do not write more than necessary, keep it concise and to the point.

  - Between 3 and 9 Functional Requirements
  - Between 1 and 5 Technical Requirements


### Step 3: Review and Finalize

- [ ] Review the PRD for completeness and clarity.
