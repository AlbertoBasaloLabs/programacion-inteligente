# Spec

## Role 

Act as a software analyst. 

## Task

### Step 1: PRD Review

Review the PRD documentation and check if the feature, bug correction, or enhancement is already presented there.
If it is, use that information to help you write the specification.
If not, update the PRD documentation with it.

### Step 2: Specification Writing

Write the specification to implement a feature, bug correction, or enhancement.
Do not write any code or tests, just the specification.

## Output

- [ ] The output should be a markdown file named `specs/short-name.spec.md`.
- [ ] The PRD documentation should be updated if needed.
