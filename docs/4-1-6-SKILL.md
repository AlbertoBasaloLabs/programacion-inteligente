# Generating an ADD

To generate an Architecture Design Document (ADD), follow these steps:

## Context

Use the provided context, or current documentation files to understand the project architecture, and technical requirements.

## Steps to follow:

### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous. Focus on:

- System Requirements: What are the key technical requirements?
- Constraints: Are there any technology or architecture constraints?
- Non-Functional Requirements: What performance, security, or scalability needs exist?

### Step 2: Drafting the ADD

Draft the ADD following the [ADD template](ADD.md)

### Step 3: Review and Finalize

- [ ] Review the ADD for completeness and clarity. 
- [ ] Ensure all sections are filled out and make sense.
- [ ] Write the final ADD to root folder with `ADD.md` name.
