# Unit test plan

## 1 Make a plan
Use `Plan` mode in whole screen with all needed tools.

```md
I want to unit test my code.
1. Help me choose one lib/framework.
2. Install and configure it to be run with `npm run test:dev`
3. Update documentation, specially 
- AGENTS.md (be concise, with minimal instructions)
- .agents/ADD.md (explain architectural paterns and decisions related to testing)
- .agents/PRD.md (minimal updates to reflect the new testing capabilities)
4.Write a unit-test skill with basic instructions for agents to follow during coding sessions.
```

## 2 Prepare the plan
Save the plan as a markdown file named `.agents/specs/add-unit-test.plan.md` 

Create a new branch named `chore/add-unit-test` and commit the plan file to it.

## 3 Implement the plan

Implement the plan in the next coding session.
