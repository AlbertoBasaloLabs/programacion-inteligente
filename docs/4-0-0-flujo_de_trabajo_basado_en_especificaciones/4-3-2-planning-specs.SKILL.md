# Plan Specifications

## Context

- Read any architecture documentation or coding guides to understand the project structure and conventions.
- Analyze the specification provided to understand the requirements and scope.

## Steps

1. Think about a detailed implementation plan for the specification.
2. Break down the implementation into 3 to 9 steps with 2 to 5 tasks each.
3. Follow the format in the [Implementation Plan template](./PLAN.md).
4. Add the plan to the issue body after the specification content.
5. Ensure the plan is clear and actionable with checkboxes for each task.
6. Add/Update references for the implementation at the start of the plan.
