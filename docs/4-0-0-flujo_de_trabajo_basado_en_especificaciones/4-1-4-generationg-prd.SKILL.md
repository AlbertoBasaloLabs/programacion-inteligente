# Generating a PRD

Understand the project idea, stakeholders, target users, and business objectives.

## Context

Use the provided context, or current documentation files. 

Read and follow any specific [PRD template](PRD.md) 

## Steps to follow:

### Step 1: Clarifying Questions

Ask only critical questions where the initial prompt is ambiguous. Focus on:

- Problem/Goal: What problem does this solve?
- Target Users: Who will use this product?
- Core Functionality: What are the key actions?
- Scope/Boundaries: What should it NOT do?

### Step 2: Drafting the PRD

Draft the PRD following the [PRD template](PRD.md)
Do not write more than necessary, keep it concise and to the point.

- Specifically cover:
  - Between 3 and 9 Functional Requirements
  - Between 1 and 5 Technical Requirements

> Less is better. Focus on essential.

### Step 3: OPTIONAL Update from legacy project

Review relevant existing documentation:
 - CHANGELOG.md, specs files, README.md, AGENTS.md, ADD.md, etc.

Update PRD feature status based on current source code, and changelog
