# AIDD skills catalog

A 9-skill pipeline covering the whole SDLC. Fewer skills, fewer artifacts.
`/specify` stays at the outcome level; `/planify` owns the per-container breakdown and the transversal e2e plan. `/codify` implements and `/verify` checks — implementation and verification never share a session.

This catalog is the inventory; the [lifecycle map](./skills.lifecycle.md) shows how the skills cover build, maintenance, and refactoring.

## Architect

| Skill | What it does | Produces |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| [`/explore`](./explore/) | AIDD setup + C4L2 | `{Agents_File}` (`AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`), `arch/system.arch.md` |
| [`/extract`](./extract/) | per container: C4L3 components + container code rules | `arch/{container}.arch.md`, `{Agents_Folder}/rules/{container}.rules.md` |

## Builder

| Skill | What it does | Produces |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| [`/specify`](./specify/) | Spec: per-container expected results + acceptance criteria (no technical detail) | `specs/{slug}/spec.md` |
| [`/planify`](./planify/) | One plan per container + a transversal e2e plan | `specs/{slug}/{container}.plan.md`, `specs/{slug}/e2e.plan.md` |
| [`/codify`](./codify/) | Implement one container plan: functional code + unit tests | source, unit tests |
| [`/verify`](./verify/) | Write+run e2e from the e2e plan; report and fix defects in a loop (rectify folded in) | e2e tests, `specs/{slug}/e2e.report.md` |

## Craftsman

| Skill | What it does | Produces |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| [`/review`](./review/) | Audit a11y/security/perf + clean-code; fix in place (refactor folded in) | `fix`/`refactor` commit |
| [`/release`](./release/) | Version, changelog, spec `done`; stamps `superseded-by:` on amended specs | `CHANGELOG.md`, version bump |
| [`/modify`](./modify/) | Triage a change to a released feature: implementation defect → direct fix; requirement change → amending spec | `fix` commit, or handoff to `/specify` with `amends:` |

## Pipeline

`/explore` -> `/extract` -> `/specify` -> `/planify` -> `/codify` (×container) -> `/verify` -> `/review` -> `/release`

Each architect step is mode-aware (greenfield prescribes, brownfield extracts).
`/codify` runs once per container (sessions can be parallel); `/verify` loops on the e2e report until green, escalating structural defects back to `/planify`.

The `e2e` container is a container like any other (runnable, documented by `/extract`) but transversal: it verifies the functional containers, has no section in the spec's solution overview, and is planned via `e2e.plan.md` and owned by `/verify` — never `/codify`.

## Maintenance

Specs are commits; arch docs are HEAD. A `done` spec is the immutable record of what its `released-version` shipped — never edit it. Changes to released features enter via `/modify`, which triages with one question: *does the current code pass the released acceptance criteria?*

- Code violates a criterion → implementation defect: direct fix + regression test + patch `/release`. No spec artifacts.
- Code matches the criteria (including bad analysis or wrong criteria) → requirement change: new spec via `/specify` with `amends: {old-slug}`, full pipeline; `/release` stamps `superseded-by:` on the old spec.

Refactoring never needs a spec (the *what* doesn't change) and routes by blast radius:

- Ugly internals, contracts intact → `/review` (behavior-preserving; proof = existing tests green).
- Contracts or components must move → structural refactor: `/planify` (no spec; criterion = existing e2e suite green, untouched) → `/codify` → `/extract` brownfield to re-sync arch docs.
- Before a big change on messy code, prefer a preparatory `/review` pass on the affected scope — make the change easy, then make the easy change.
- If staying green would require changing a test's assertion, it was never a refactor: route through `/modify`.
